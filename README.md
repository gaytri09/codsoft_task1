Welcome to the Number Guessing Game repository! This project is an interactive game where users attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

Features:
1.Random Number Generation: The game generates a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).
2.User Input: Users can input their guessed numbers through the command line interface.
3.Feedback: After each guess, the game provides feedback to the user, indicating whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct.
4.Looping Structure: The game loops until the user correctly guesses the number.
5.Score Tracking: Optionally, the game can track the number of attempts it takes for the user to guess the correct number.
6.Range Configuration: The range of numbers to guess from can be configured, allowing for different levels of difficulty.
7.Validation: Input validation ensures that users enter valid numerical guesses.
